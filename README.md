Operating System Scheduling Algorithms using Java

Note: All of the algorithms are based on OOP but they don't have any setters or getters because this was meant for my classmates in Operating System who can't understand arrays/mutli-dimensional/methods or have a little experience in coding but I still want to them understand the code.


# This Repository Contains The Following Algorithms:

- [ ] First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- [x] Shortest Job First (SJF)
- [x] Shortest Remaining Time First(SRTF)
